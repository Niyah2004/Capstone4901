# Task Management - Future Improvements

## Issue: Task Time/Date Visibility

**Problem:**
- When a parent creates a task for "today" with the current time, by the time the child views it, the time has already passed
- Tasks with past times don't show up in "Today's Tasks"

**Suggested Solutions:**
1. **Calendar View Option** - Allow children to see tasks from past dates, not just today
2. **Time Range Adjustment** - Change the time query to show all tasks for the selected date regardless of time
3. **Default Time** - Set tasks to always start at beginning of day (12:00 AM) instead of current time
4. **Past Tasks View** - Add a separate view to see incomplete tasks from previous days

## Priority
- Low priority (workaround: create tasks for future dates)
- Can be addressed in future sprint
